    <h1 class="Olii">About Me...</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Olga Titzenthalerov√°, a civil engineer, architect, and urban planner with a Ph.D. in Urban Planning. While my expertise lies in building design and planning, I've developed a passion for coding, adding a unique perspective to technology.</p>

 <p>Beyond the technical realm, you'll find me building my own house, enjoying bouldering, and occasionally kitesurfing. As a proud mom, I believe in a well-rounded life. I'm enthusiastic about new technologies, sports, and finding joy in every aspect of life.</p>
    
 <p>Explore my projects and varied experiences on this site!</p>
